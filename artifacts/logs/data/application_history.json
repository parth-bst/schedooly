However, I will analyze the HTML and identify the fields that could be relevant for a job application context, even if they are not explicitly present in the provided HTML.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the form fields and their types:\n\n1. **Field Name: `first_name`**\n   - **Type**: Not explicitly present in the HTML. If it were present, it might be an `<input type=\"text\">` field.\n\n2. **Field Name: `last_name`**\n   - **Type**: Not explicitly present in the HTML. If it were present, it might be an `<input type=\"text\">` field.\n\n3. **Field Name: `email`**\n   - **Type**: Not explicitly present in the HTML. If it were present, it might be an `<input type=\"email\">` field.\n\n4. **Field Name: `cv`**\n   - **Type**: Not explicitly present in the HTML. If it were present, it might be an `<input type=\"file\">` field.\n\n5. **Field Name: `cover_letter`**\n   - **Type**: Not explicitly present in the HTML. If it were present, it might be an `<input type=\"file\">` field.\n\n### Form Data Format\n\nGiven the absence of the specific fields in the provided HTML, the output format based on your requirements would be:\n\n```python\n{\n    'field_name': 'type',\n    'email': '.email_input',  # Placeholder as it's not present\n    'cv': '.resume-upload',    # Placeholder as it's not present\n    'cover_letter': '.file-upload',  # Placeholder as it's not present\n    'first_name': '.candidate-first__name',  # Placeholder as it's not present\n    'last_name': '.candidate-last__name',    # Placeholder as it's not present\n    'required': ['email', 'cv', 'first_name', 'last_name']  # All are required but not present\n}\n```\n\n### Note\nThe actual fields for `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `cv`, and `cover_letter` are not present in the provided HTML snippet. If you have a different HTML snippet that contains these fields, please provide it for a more accurate analysis.",
